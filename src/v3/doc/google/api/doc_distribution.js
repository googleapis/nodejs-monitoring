/**
 * `Distribution` contains summary statistics for a population of values. It
 * optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of those values
 * across a set of buckets.
 *
 * The summary statistics are the count, mean, sum of the squared deviation from
 * the mean, the minimum, and the maximum of the set of population of values.
 * The histogram is based on a sequence of buckets and gives a count of values
 * that fall into each bucket. The boundaries of the buckets are given either
 * explicitly or by formulas for buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing
 * widths.
 *
 * Although it is not forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include
 * non-finite values (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this
 * will render the `mean` and `sum_of_squared_deviation` fields meaningless.
 *
 * @property {number} count
 *   The number of values in the population. Must be non-negative. This value
 *   must equal the sum of the values in `bucket_counts` if a histogram is
 *   provided.
 *
 * @property {number} mean
 *   The arithmetic mean of the values in the population. If `count` is zero
 *   then this field must be zero.
 *
 * @property {number} sumOfSquaredDeviation
 *   The sum of squared deviations from the mean of the values in the
 *   population. For values x_i this is:
 *
 *       Sum\[i=1..n](x_1 - mean)^2
 *
 *   Knuth, "The Art of Computer Programming", Vol. 2, page 323, 3rd edition
 *   describes Welford's method for accumulating this sum in one pass.
 *
 *   If `count` is zero then this field must be zero.
 *
 * @property {Object} range
 *   If specified, contains the range of the population values. The field
 *   must not be present if the `count` is zero.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Range]{@link google.api.Range}
 *
 * @property {Object} bucketOptions
 *   Defines the histogram bucket boundaries. If the distribution does not
 *   contain a histogram, then omit this field.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [BucketOptions]{@link google.api.BucketOptions}
 *
 * @property {number[]} bucketCounts
 *   The number of values in each bucket of the histogram, as described in
 *   `bucket_options`. If the distribution does not have a histogram, then omit
 *   this field. If there is a histogram, then the sum of the values in
 *   `bucket_counts` must equal the value in the `count` field of the
 *   distribution.
 *
 *   If present, `bucket_counts` should contain N values, where N is the number
 *   of buckets specified in `bucket_options`. If you supply fewer than N
 *   values, the remaining values are assumed to be 0.
 *
 *   The order of the values in `bucket_counts` follows the bucket numbering
 *   schemes described for the three bucket types. The first value must be the
 *   count for the underflow bucket (number 0). The next N-2 values are the
 *   counts for the finite buckets (number 1 through N-2). The N'th value in
 *   `bucket_counts` is the count for the overflow bucket (number N-1).
 *
 * @property {Object[]} exemplars
 *   Must be in increasing order of `value` field.

   * `BucketOptions` describes the bucket boundaries used to create a histogram

   * exponential sequence, or each bucket can be specified explicitly.
   * `BucketOptions` does not include the number of values in each bucket.
   *
   * A bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the
   * values that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket must
   * be strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a
   * distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more
   * finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N -
   * 1). The buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i > 0) is the
   * same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range
   * of finite values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the
