/**
 * This message configures which resources and services to monitor for
 * availability.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   A unique resource name for this UptimeCheckConfig. The format is:
 *
 *
 *     `projects/[PROJECT_ID]/uptimeCheckConfigs/[UPTIME_CHECK_ID]`.
 *
 *   This field should be omitted when creating the uptime check configuration;
 *   on create, the resource name is assigned by the server and included in the
 *   response.
 *
 * @property {string} displayName
 *   A human-friendly name for the uptime check configuration. The display name
 *   should be unique within a Stackdriver Account in order to make it easier
 *   to identify; however, uniqueness is not enforced. Required.
 *
 * @property {Object} monitoredResource
 *   The monitored resource associated with the configuration.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [MonitoredResource]{@link google.api.MonitoredResource}
 *
 * @property {Object} resourceGroup
 *   The group resource associated with the configuration.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ResourceGroup]{@link google.monitoring.v3.ResourceGroup}
 *
 * @property {Object} httpCheck
 *   Contains information needed to make an HTTP or HTTPS check.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [HttpCheck]{@link google.monitoring.v3.HttpCheck}
 *
 * @property {Object} tcpCheck
 *   Contains information needed to make a TCP check.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [TcpCheck]{@link google.monitoring.v3.TcpCheck}
 *
 * @property {Object} period
 *   How often the uptime check is performed.
 *   Currently, only 1, 5, 10, and 15 minutes are supported. Required.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Duration]{@link google.protobuf.Duration}
 *
 * @property {Object} timeout
 *   The maximum amount of time to wait for the request to complete (must be
 *   between 1 and 60 seconds). Required.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Duration]{@link google.protobuf.Duration}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} contentMatchers
 *   The expected content on the page the check is run against.
 *   Currently, only the first entry in the list is supported, and other entries
 *   will be ignored. The server will look for an exact match of the string in
 *   the page response's content. This field is optional and should only be
 *   specified if a content match is required.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [ContentMatcher]{@link google.monitoring.v3.ContentMatcher}
 *
 * @property {number[]} selectedRegions
 *   The list of regions from which the check will be run.
 *   If this field is specified, enough regions to include a minimum of
 *   3 locations must be provided, or an error message is returned.
 *   Not specifying this field will result in uptime checks running from all
 *   regions.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [UptimeCheckRegion]{@link google.monitoring.v3.UptimeCheckRegion}
 *
 * @property {Object[]} internalCheckers
 *   The internal checkers that this check will egress from.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [InternalChecker]{@link google.monitoring.v3.InternalChecker}
 *
 * @typedef UptimeCheckConfig
