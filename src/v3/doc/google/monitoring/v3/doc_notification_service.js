 *   descriptors; to retrieve a single descriptor by name, use the
 *   GetNotificationChannelDescriptor
 *   operation, instead.
 *
 * @property {number} pageSize
 *   The maximum number of results to return in a single response. If
 *   not set to a positive number, a reasonable value will be chosen by the
 *   service.
 *
 * @property {string} pageToken
 *   If non-empty, `page_token` must contain a value returned as the
 *   `next_page_token` in a previous response to request the next set
 *   of results.
